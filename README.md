### REACT CALCULATOR APP

## DESCRIPTION
You want to create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
To solve this problem, you can use two states to store the two numbers that the user enters. The first state can be used to store the first number, and the second state can be used to store the second number. You can then use the useState hook to update the states when the user changes the numbers.
